# EPIC 1 Stories: Core Canvas Functionality

This document breaks down EPIC 1 into individual user stories, following the INVEST principles.

### Story 1: Infinite Canvas View

- **As a** user,
- **I want** an endless canvas workspace,
- **so that** I am not constrained by predefined boundaries and can freely organize my tasks and ideas.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The canvas must not have visible edges or borders.
- The canvas area must expand automatically when I pan near the edge of the currently visible area.
- Performance must remain smooth even when content is spread across a large area.

---

### Story 2: Visual Grid System

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to see a non-intrusive dotted grid on the canvas background,
- **so that** I have a visual guide to help me align elements consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A grid of dots must be rendered on the canvas background.
- The grid must pan and zoom along with the canvas.
- The grid's appearance (e.g., light grey dots) should be subtle and not visually distracting.

### Story 3: Canvas Panning

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to pan the canvas in any direction (horizontally and vertically),
- **so that** I can navigate to different areas of my workspace.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- I can pan by clicking and dragging the canvas background.
- The cursor must change to a "grab" or "hand" icon during panning.
- Panning must be smooth and responsive, without visual tearing.
- Panning with a trackpad (two-finger scroll) should be supported.

### Story 4: Canvas Zooming

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to zoom in and out on the canvas,
- **so that** I can either get a high-level overview of my entire project or focus on the details of a specific section.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- I can zoom using the mouse scroll wheel (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd + scroll).
- Zooming must be centered on the current position of the mouse cursor.
- All elements on the canvas, including the grid, must scale proportionally and smoothly.

### Story 5: Snap-to-Grid Alignment

- **As a** user,
- **I want** objects to automatically snap to the nearest grid point when I move them,
- **so that** I can align my cards and links perfectly without tedious manual adjustments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- When a card is dragged and released, its final position must be the coordinates of the nearest grid dot.
- A visual indicator should show the potential snap location during the drag operation.
- The snapping behavior must be enabled by default.

### Story 6: Responsive Canvas Layout

- **As a** user,
- **I want** the canvas view to adapt to the size of my browser window,
- **so that** the application is usable across different screen resolutions and device sizes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- When the browser window is resized, the canvas viewport must adjust to fill the available space.
- UI elements like the taskbar must remain fixed and accessible.
- No canvas content should be inadvertently hidden or cut off by the resizing.
