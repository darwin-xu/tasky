# EPIC 4 Stories: Application Shell & UI

This document breaks down EPIC 4 into individual user stories, following the INVEST principles.

---

### Story 1: Fixed Top Taskbar

- **As a** user,
- **I want** a fixed taskbar at the top of the window,
- **so that** I have consistent access to global controls while working on the canvas.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The taskbar remains fixed at the top on scroll, pan, and zoom.
- The taskbar does not overlap interactive canvas content (canvas layout accounts for its height).
- The taskbar is responsive, maintaining usability across common screen sizes.

---

### Story 2: Create Task Button

- **As a** user,
- **I want** a "Create Task" button in the taskbar,
- **so that** I can quickly add new tasks without searching for controls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Clicking "Create Task" creates a Task card on the canvas (at cursor location if applicable, otherwise centered) and focuses it for editing.
- The button shows a hover and active state to indicate interactivity.
- The operation respects canvas snap-to-grid and does not impact pan/zoom behavior.

### Story 3: Configuration Menu

- **As a** user,
- **I want** a Configuration menu accessible from the taskbar,
- **so that** I can manage application-level settings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A clearly labeled or icon-based entry (e.g., gear icon) opens a menu or panel.
- The menu supports at least: grid on/off, snap-to-grid on/off, theme (light/dark) toggle.
- Changes apply immediately to the current session and persist in in-memory state.

### Story 4: Global UI Style Guidelines

- **As a** user,
- **I want** a clean, minimal, and modern UI,
- **so that** the app is pleasant and easy to use.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Adopt a consistent design system (e.g., shadcn/ui or Material-UI) for buttons, menus, inputs.
- Apply consistent rounded corners, subtle shadows, and clear typography across the app shell and card components.
- Spacing, color, and typography scale appropriately across breakpoints.

---

### Story 5: Keyboard and Focus Accessibility

- **As a** keyboard user,
- **I want** to navigate and operate the taskbar and menus without a mouse,
- **so that** the interface is accessible.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All taskbar and menu controls are reachable via Tab/Shift+Tab and have visible focus indicators.
- Escape closes open menus/panels without side effects.
- Controls have accessible names/labels for screen readers.

---

### Story 6: Modal or Inline Editors for Cards

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to edit cards via a consistent editor experience (modal or inline),
- **so that** I can update content efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Triggering edit on a card opens the chosen editor pattern (modal or inline) with inputs for that card type.
- Save/Cancel flows are clear and predictable; closing without save does not persist changes.
- Editor layout follows the global UI style and is responsive.

---

### Story 7: Non-Blocking UI Overlays

- **As a** user,
- **I want** overlays (menus, modals) to behave predictably with the canvas,
- **so that** I can keep context while interacting with global controls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Overlays appear above the canvas and do not trigger unintended canvas pans/zooms.
- Clicking outside an open overlay closes it (when appropriate) and returns focus logically.
- Overlay z-index and layering are consistent with links/cards and the grid.

---

### Story 8: Theming Support (Light/Dark)

- **As a** user,
- **I want** to switch between light and dark themes,
- **so that** I can use the app comfortably in different environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A theme toggle is accessible from the Configuration menu.
- Theme choices apply across the app shell and canvas components (grid, cards, links) for legibility.
- The chosen theme persists in memory for the session.

---

### Story 9: Layout Responsiveness & Safe Areas

- **As a** user,
- **I want** the application shell to adapt to different screen sizes and safe areas,
- **so that** the UI remains usable and uncluttered.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Taskbar and menus adjust layout/spacing for narrow and wide screens.
- Content respects safe areas and avoids overflow or clipping.
- No canvas content is obscured by the app shell.

---

### Story 10: Performance & Visual Fidelity of Shell

- **As a** user,
- **I want** the shell to render smoothly without jank,
- **so that** the experience remains responsive while I work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Opening/closing menus and modals does not cause frame drops or layout shifts.
- Shadow/blur effects and transitions are subtle and do not interfere with readability.
- The shell maintains responsiveness alongside canvas interactions (pan/zoom/drag).
