## Product Code Tasks

### Task 1: Initial Canvas Component Setup
**Description:** Create a new React component, `InfiniteCanvas`, that will serve as the main workspace using Konva.js for canvas management.

**Implementation Details:**
1. Install `react-konva` and `konva` packages via npm
2. Create `src/components/InfiniteCanvas.tsx` (TypeScript React component)
3. Define component props interface with optional `width`, `height`, `className` properties
4. Implement component structure:
   - Use `useRef` hook for Konva Stage reference
   - Use `useEffect` hook for container size detection and resize listener
   - Render Konva `Stage` with 100% width/height of parent container
   - Include a base `Layer` for future canvas content
5. Export component as default export
6. Add basic CSS styling for full container coverage

**Test Cases:**

#### TC1.1: Component Initialization (Positive Case)
**Test Steps:**
1. Render `<InfiniteCanvas />` within a 800x600px container using React Testing Library
2. Wait for component to mount and useEffect to complete
3. Query for canvas element in DOM

**Expected Behavior:**
- Component renders without throwing errors
- Canvas element exists in DOM with `canvas` tag
- Canvas dimensions match container (800x600px)
- No console errors or warnings

#### TC1.2: Component with Custom Props (Positive Case)
**Test Steps:**
1. Render `<InfiniteCanvas width={1200} height={900} className="custom-canvas" />`
2. Query canvas element and check attributes

**Expected Behavior:**
- Canvas has width=1200 and height=900 attributes
- Canvas container has "custom-canvas" CSS class applied

#### TC1.3: Component in Zero-Size Container (Edge Case)
**Test Steps:**
1. Render component in container with 0x0 dimensions
2. Check canvas rendering and console for errors

**Expected Behavior:**
- Component doesn't crash
- Canvas renders with minimum 1x1 dimensions or gracefully handles zero size
- No JavaScript errors thrown

#### TC1.4: Component Unmounting (Cleanup Test)
**Test Steps:**
1. Render component and capture any event listeners
2. Unmount component using React Testing Library
3. Check for memory leaks or remaining listeners

**Expected Behavior:**
- All event listeners are cleaned up
- No memory leaks detected
- Component unmounts cleanly

### Task 2: Implement Viewport State Management
**Description:** Create a comprehensive state management system for canvas viewport including position, scale, and bounds tracking.

**Implementation Details:**
1. Define viewport state interface with properties:
   - `x: number` (horizontal offset)
   - `y: number` (vertical offset) 
   - `scale: number` (zoom level, default 1.0)
   - `isDragging: boolean` (pan state flag)
2. Implement custom hook `useViewportState()` with:
   - State initialization with default values (x: 0, y: 0, scale: 1, isDragging: false)
   - Action methods: `updatePosition()`, `updateScale()`, `setDragging()`
   - Validation logic for scale bounds (min: 0.1, max: 10.0)
   - Memoized state object to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. Apply viewport state to Konva Stage props:
   - `x={viewport.x}`, `y={viewport.y}`
   - `scaleX={viewport.scale}`, `scaleY={viewport.scale}`
4. Add debugging capabilities with state logging (development mode only)

**Test Cases:**

#### TC2.1: Initial State Values (Positive Case)

3. Attempt to set scale to 0 (invalid)
4. Attempt to set scale to negative value

**Expected Behavior:**

2. Check state update and rendering performance
3. Verify no precision loss or overflow

**Expected Behavior:**
- Large coordinates stored accurately

### Task 3: Implement Panning Logic
**Description:** Create mouse/touch-based panning functionality with smooth interaction handling and visual feedback.

**Implementation Details:**
1. Add mouse event handlers to Konva Stage:
   - `onMouseDown`: Initiate pan operation, capture start position, set dragging state
   - `onMouseMove`: Calculate delta movement, update viewport position (only when dragging)
   - `onMouseUp`: End pan operation, reset dragging state
   - `onMouseLeave`: Handle edge case when mouse leaves canvas during drag
2. Implement touch support for mobile devices:
   - `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd` events
   - Single-touch panning (ignore multi-touch for now)
3. Add cursor visual feedback:
   - Default cursor: "grab"
   - During panning: "grabbing"  
   - CSS cursor changes applied to canvas container
4. Implement delta calculation logic:
   - Store previous mouse position in component state
   - Calculate delta as `currentPos - previousPos`
   - Apply delta to viewport position: `newPos = currentPos + delta`
5. Add panning constraints and boundary handling (if needed)
6. Optimize performance with requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
