# Tasks for User Story: Infinite Canvas View

This document breaks down the user story "Infinite Canvas View" into specific, actionable tasks for both development (product code) and quality assurance (test cases).

---

### User Story: Infinite Canvas View
*   **As a** user,
*   **I want** an endless canvas workspace,
*   **so that** I am not constrained by predefined boundaries and can freely organize my tasks and ideas.

---

### Product Code Tasks

1.  **Task 1: Initial Canvas Component Setup**
    *   **Description:** Create a new React component, `InfiniteCanvas`, that will serve as the main workspace. This component will use a canvas library (e.g., Konva.js) to manage the stage, layers, and basic rendering.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Install and configure `react-konva`.
        *   Create the `InfiniteCanvas` component.
        *   Render a basic `Stage` and `Layer` from `react-konva` that fills the parent container.

2.  **Task 2: Implement Viewport State Management**
    *   **Description:** Manage the canvas's camera or viewport position (`x`, `y`) and `zoom` level. This state will define the visible portion of the infinite canvas.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Use a state management solution (e.g., `useState` or Zustand) within the `InfiniteCanvas` component to store the viewport's `x`, `y` offset and `scale`.
        *   Pass these state variables to the Konva `Stage` component (`x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`).

3.  **Task 3: Implement Panning Logic**
    *   **Description:** Allow the user to pan the canvas by clicking and dragging the background. This involves updating the viewport's `x` and `y` state.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Add event handlers (`onMouseDown`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseUp`) to the Konva `Stage`.
        *   On drag, calculate the delta in mouse position and update the viewport's `x` and `y` state accordingly.
        *   Change the cursor to a "grabbing" hand icon during the pan operation for better UX.

4.  **Task 4: Ensure Unbounded Coordinate System**
    *   **Description:** The core logic must support arbitrarily large coordinate values for the viewport position, effectively making the canvas "infinite."
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Verify that there are no artificial limits or clamps on the `x` and `y` state values during panning.
        *   Ensure the underlying canvas library can handle large coordinate transformations without performance degradation or precision issues.

### Test Case Tasks

1.  **Test Case 1: Canvas Renders Correctly**
    *   **Description:** Verify that the `InfiniteCanvas` component mounts and renders the underlying canvas element without any errors.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Write a unit test using React Testing Library that renders the `InfiniteCanvas` component.
        *   Assert that the component does not throw any errors on initial render.
        *   Assert that a `<canvas>` element is present in the DOM.

2.  **Test Case 2: Panning Updates Viewport State**
    *   **Description:** Confirm that dragging the canvas correctly updates its internal viewport state.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Write a test that simulates a `mousedown` event, followed by a `mousemove` event, and finally a `mouseup` event.
        *   Assert that the component's internal state for `x` and `y` has changed by the expected delta from the simulated drag.

3.  **Test Case 3: Panning to Extreme Coordinates**
    *   **Description:** Ensure the canvas remains stable and functional when panned to very large coordinate values.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Write a test that simulates a long-distance pan (e.g., 1,000,000 pixels).
        *   Assert that the viewport state correctly reflects the new, large coordinate values.
        *   Assert that the component does not crash or enter an error state.

4.  **Test Case 4: Viewport Responds to Window Resizing**
    *   **Description:** Verify that the canvas viewport correctly resizes to fill its container when the browser window size changes.
    *   **To-Do:**
        *   Write a test that renders the component within a container of a specific size.
        *   Programmatically change the size of the container.
        *   Assert that the canvas element's `width` and `height` attributes have updated to match the new container size.
